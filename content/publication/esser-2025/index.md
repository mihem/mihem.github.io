abstract: Anti-Leucine-rich glioma inactivated-1 (LGI1) and anti-contactin-associated-protein-2
  (CASPR2) autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) are common and characterized by pathogenic
  antibodies targeting neuronal autoantigens. However, the drivers of the antibody-secreting
  cells (ASC) and involvement of T cells remain unresolved. We performed single cell
  RNA-sequencing of fresh cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and parallel blood samples of
  15 patients with LGI1- (n=9) and CASPR2-AIE (n=6) compared to control patients (multiple
  sclerosis (MS) n=15, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) n=18). We validated
  our observations in independent cohorts using flow cytometry of CSF and blood. We
  confirmed autoantibody specificity using recombinant human monoclonal antibodies.
  Compared to IIH and MS controls, we observed clonal CSF-specific ASC expansion in
  LGI1/CASPR2-AIE despite mostly normal CSF findings. ASCs were dominantly plasmablasts
  and transcribed IgG4 and IgG1/2 heavy chains. Expanded clones showed signs of affinity
  maturation and bound the respective neuronal autoantigen. Within CD4 and CD8 T cell
  clusters, CD4 and CD8 central memory T cells were activated, clonally restricted
  and expanded. T cell clones were often shared between CSF and blood. We also observed
  a shift of NK cells and loss of mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in the
  CSF of LGI1- and blood of LGI1- and CASPR2-AIE compared to IIH and MS controls.
  Indeed, MAIT-like T cells were detected in autopsy brains of LGI1 and CASPR2-AIE
  patients and mice lacking MAIT cells displayed an increased antibody seroconversion
  and higher titers following active LGI1-/CASPR2 immunization. Our data (1) confirms
  the intrathecal antigen-specific plasma cell expansion in LGI1- and CASPR2-AIE in
  a large cohort of untreated AIE patients, (2) suggests that activated and expanded
  central memory CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CSF participate in disease pathogenesis
  and (3) for the first time implicates invariant T cell receptor expressing lymphocytes
  in the brain, CSF and blood in disease pathogenesis. o̧pyright The Author(s) 2025.
