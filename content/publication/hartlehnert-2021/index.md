title: Bcl6 controls meningeal Th17-B cell interaction in murine neuroinflammation.
subtitle: ''
summary: By generating a compartment-specific transcriptional map of meningeal versus
  parenchymal leukocytes in experimental neuroinflammation, we found a follicular
  phenotype of meningeal B cells and a corresponding follicular helper-like phenotype
  in meningeal Th17 cells. The meninges thus instructed a site-specific local phenotype
  to proinflammatory autoreactive T cells. We identified the transcription factor
  Bcl6 in Th17 cells to promote interactions with meningeal B cells, isotype-switching,
  and B cell-supporting chemokines. This may describe a mechanism controlling meningeal
  autoimmunity and helps understanding how the meninges, as a recently recognized
  immunologically active site, contribute to autoimmune tissue damage in multiple
  sclerosis.

abstract: Ectopic lymphoid tissue containing B cells forms in the meninges at late
  stages of human multiple sclerosis (MS) and when neuroinflammation is induced by
  interleukin (IL)-17 producing T helper (Th17) cells in rodents. B cell differentiation
  and the subsequent release of class-switched immunoglobulins have been speculated
  to occur in the meninges, but the exact cellular composition and underlying mechanisms
  of meningeal-dominated inflammation remain unknown. Here, we performed in-depth
  characterization of meningeal versus parenchymal Th17-induced rodent neuroinflammation.
  The most pronounced cellular and transcriptional differences between these compartments
  was the localization of B cells exhibiting a follicular phenotype exclusively to
  the meninges. Correspondingly, meningeal but not parenchymal Th17 cells acquired
  a B cell-supporting phenotype and resided in close contact with B cells. This preferential
  B cell tropism for the meninges and the formation of meningeal ectopic lymphoid
  tissue was partially dependent on the expression of the transcription factor Bcl6
  in Th17 cells that is required in other T cell lineages to induce isotype class
  switching in B cells. A function of Bcl6 in Th17 cells was only detected in vivo
  and was reflected by the induction of B cell-supporting cytokines, the appearance
  of follicular B cells in the meninges, and of immunoglobulin class switching in
  the cerebrospinal fluid. We thus identify the induction of a B cell-supporting meningeal
  microenvironment by Bcl6 in Th17 cells as a mechanism controlling compartment specificity
  in neuroinflammation.
