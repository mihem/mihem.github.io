abstract: Although glucocorticoids (GC) represent the most frequently used immunosuppressive
  drugs, their effects are still not well understood. In our previous studies, we
  have shown that treatment of monocytes with GC does not cause a global suppression
  of monocytic effector functions, but rather induces differentiation of a specific
  anti-inflammatory phenotype. The anti-inflammatory role of peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor (PPAR)-γ has been extensively studied during recent years. However, a relationship
  between GC treatment and PPAR-γ expression in macrophages has not been investigated
  so far. Studies using PPAR-γ-deficient mice have frequently provided controversial
  results. A potential reason is the use of primary cells, which commonly represent
  inhomogeneous populations burdened with side effects and influenced by bystander
  cells. To overcome this constraint, we established ER-Hoxb8-immortalized bone marrow-derived
  macrophages from Ppargfl/fl and LysM-Cre Ppargfl/fl mice in this study. In contrast
  to primary macrophages, the ER-Hoxb8 system allows the generation of a homogeneous
  and well-defined population of resting macrophages. We could show that the loss
  of PPAR-γ resulted in delayed kinetic of differentiation of monocytes into macrophages
  as assessed by reduced F4/80, but increased Ly6C expression in early phases of differentiation.
  As expected, PPAR-γ-deficient macrophages displayed an increased pro-inflammatory
  phenotype upon long-term LPS stimulation characterized by an elevated production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6, IL-12 and a reduced production
  of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 compared to PPAR-γ WT cells. Moreover, PPAR-γ-deficient
  macrophages showed impaired phagocytosis. GC treatment of macrophages led to the
  upregulation of PPAR-γ expression. However, there were no differences in GC-induced
  suppression of cytokines between both cell types, implicating a PPAR-γ-independent
  mechanism. Intriguingly, GC treatment resulted in an increased in vitro migration
  only in PPAR-γ-deficient macrophages. Performing a newly developed in vivo cell-tracking
  experiment, we could confirm that GC induces an increased recruitment of PPAR-γ
  KO, but not PPAR-γ WT macrophages to the site of inflammation. Our findings suggest
  a specific effect of PPAR-γ on GC-induced migration in macrophages. In conclusion,
  we could demonstrate that PPAR-γ exerts anti-inflammatory activities and shapes
  macrophage functions. Moreover, we identified a molecular link between GC and PPAR-γ
  and could show for the first time that PPAR-γ modulates GC-induced migration in
  macrophages.
