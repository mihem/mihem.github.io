abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy for the treatment of
  neurological autoimmune diseases is promising, but CAR T cell kinetics and immune
  alterations after treatment are poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell
  multi-omics sequencing of paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from
  patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) treated with anti-B
  cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cells. Proliferating cytotoxic-like CD8+ CAR
  T cell clones were identified as the main effectors in autoimmunity. Anti-BCMA CAR
  T cells with enhanced features of chemotaxis efficiently crossed the blood-CSF barrier,
  eliminated plasmablasts and plasma cells in the CSF, and suppressed neuroinflammation.
  The CD44-expressing early memory phenotype in infusion products was potentially
  associated with CAR T cell persistence in autoimmunity. Moreover, CAR T cells from
  patients with NMOSD displayed distinctive features of suppressed cytotoxicity compared
  with those from hematological malignancies. Thus, we provide mechanistic insights
  into CAR T cell function in patients with neurological autoimmune disease.
