abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is approved for the treatment of active relapsing-remitting
  multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Alemtuzumab-related secondary autoimmune disorders (sAID)
  are common, with thyroid sAID being the most frequent, and fundamentally affect
  the risk-benefit ratio. Therefore, biomarkers indicating the development of sAID
  are urgently needed to instruct clinical decisions. METHODS: We evaluated whether
  the anti-thyroid autoantibodies (ThyAb) anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) and anti-thyroid-peroxidase
  (anti-TPO) detected at baseline by standard testing are able to indicate increased
  risk for thyroid sAID following alemtuzumab treatment in a multicentre prospective
  cohort of 106 alemtuzumab-treated RRMS patients. We here present an interim-analysis
  with a median follow-up of 36 months. FINDINGS: Baseline characteristics demonstrated
  no significant differences between patients with or without thyroid sAID. 29/106
  (27·4%) patients developed thyroid sAID between 5 and 51 months following alemtuzumab
  treatment initiation. 14/29 patients (48·3%) were positive for ThyAb at baseline
  and developed thyroid sAID. Hazard ratio for time to thyroid autoimmunity was 12.15
  (95% CI 4.73-31.2) indicating a highly increased risk for ThyAb positive patients.
  Baseline ThyAb were associated with shorter time to sAID, but not with a specific
  disease entity of thyroid sAID. Hazard ratios for age, sex, previous treatment,
  disease duration, disability and smoking status demonstrated no significant association
  with thyroid autoimmunity. INTERPRETATION: Standard ThyAb-testing for anti-TPO and
  anti-TG antibodies at baseline was able to indicate increased risk for clinically
  manifest thyroid sAID and should therefore be used in clinical decisions concerning
  alemtuzumab treatment initiation.'
