abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare lymphoma
  of the central nervous system, usually of diffuse large B cell phenotype. Stereotactic
  biopsy followed by histopathology is the diagnostic standard. However, limited material
  is available from CNS biopsies, thus impeding an in-depth characterization of PCNSL.
  METHODS: We performed flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and B cell receptor
  sequencing of PCNSL cells released from biopsy material, blood, and cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF), and spatial transcriptomics of biopsy samples. RESULTS: PCNSL-released
  cells were predominantly activated CD19 + CD20 + CD38 + CD27 + B cells. In single-cell
  RNA sequencing, PCNSL cells were transcriptionally heterogeneous, forming multiple
  malignant B cell clusters. Hyperexpanded B cell clones were shared between biopsy-
  and CSF- but not blood-derived cells. T cells in the tumor microenvironment upregulated
  immune checkpoint molecules, thereby recognizing immune evasion signals from PCNSL
  cells. Spatial transcriptomics revealed heterogeneous spatial organization of malignant
  B cell clusters, mirroring their transcriptional heterogeneity across patients,
  and pronounced expression of T cell exhaustion markers, co-localizing with a highly
  malignant B cell cluster. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant B cells in PCNSL show transcriptional
  and spatial intratumor heterogeneity. T cell exhaustion is frequent in the PCNSL
  microenvironment, co-localizes with malignant cells, and highlights the potential
  of personalized treatments.'
