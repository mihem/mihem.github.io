abstract: 'Objective: Utilize immune cell profiles in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
  to advance the understanding and potentially support the diagnosis of inflammatory
  neuropathies. Methods: We analyzed CSF cell flow cytometry data of patients with
  definite Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS, n = 26) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating
  polyneuropathy (CIDP, n = 32) based on established diagnostic criteria in comparison
  to controls with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS, n = 49) and idiopathic
  intracranial hypertension (IIH, n = 63). Results: Flow cytometry revealed disease-specific
  changes of CSF cell composition with a significant increase of NKT cells and CD8+
  T cells in CIDP, NK cells in GBS, and B cells and plasma cells in MS in comparison
  to IIH controls. Principal component analysis demonstrated distinct CSF immune cells
  pattern in inflammatory neuropathies vs. RRMS. Systematic receiver operator curve
  (ROC) analysis identified NKT cells as the best parameter to distinguish GBS from
  CIDP. Composite scores combing several of the CSF parameters differentiated inflammatory
  neuropathies from IIH and GBS from CIDP with high confidence. Applying a novel dimension
  reduction technique, we observed an intra-disease heterogeneity of inflammatory
  neuropathies. Conclusion: Inflammatory neuropathies display disease- and subtype-specific
  alterations of CSF cell composition. The increase of NKT cells and CD8+ T cells
  in CIDP and NK cells in GBS, suggests a central role of cytotoxic cell types in
  inflammatory neuropathies varying between acute and chronic subtypes. Composite
  scores constructed from multi-dimensional CSF parameters establish potential novel
  diagnostic tools. Intra-disease heterogeneity suggests distinct disease mechanisms
  in subgroups of inflammatory neuropathies.'
