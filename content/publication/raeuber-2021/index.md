title: 'Cerebrospinal fluid flow cytometry distinguishes psychosis spectrum disorders from differential diagnoses'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'We performed basic CSF analysis and multi-dimensional flow cytometry of CSF and blood cells from 59 patients with primary psychotic disorders in comparison to inflammatory and non-inflammatory controls. We found an expansion of monocytes in the blood and CSF of psychosis patients. A machine learning model incorporating blood and CSF parameters differentated psychosis from non-inflammatory controls better than individual paramaters.'

abstract: Psychotic disorders are common and disabling mental conditions. The relative
  importance of immune-related mechanisms in psychotic disorders remains subject of
  debate. Here, we present a large-scale retrospective study of blood and cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) immune cell profiles of psychosis spectrum patients. We performed basic
  CSF analysis and multi-dimensional flow cytometry of CSF and blood cells from 59
  patients with primary psychotic disorders (F20, F22, F23, and F25) in comparison
  to inflammatory (49 RRMS and 16 NMDARE patients) and non-inflammatory controls (52
  IIH patients). We replicated the known expansion of monocytes in the blood of psychosis
  spectrum patients, that we identified to preferentially affect classical monocytes.
  In the CSF, we found a relative shift from lymphocytes to monocytes, increased protein
  levels, and evidence of blood-brain barrier disruption in psychosis. In fact, these
  CSF features confidently distinguished autoimmune encephalitis from psychosis despite
  similar (initial) clinical features. We then constructed machine learning models
  incorporating blood and CSF parameters and demonstrated their superior ability to
  differentiate psychosis from non-inflammatory controls compared to individual parameters.
  Multi-dimensional and multi-compartment immune cell signatures can thus support
  the diagnosis of psychosis spectrum disorders with the potential to accelerate diagnosis
  and initiation of therapy.
