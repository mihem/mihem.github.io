abstract: Peripheral nerves contain axons and their enwrapping glia cells named Schwann
  cells (SCs) that are either myelinating (mySCs) or nonmyelinating (nmSCs). Our understanding
  of other cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) remains limited. Here, we
  provide an unbiased single cell transcriptomic characterization of the nondiseased
  rodent PNS. We identified and independently confirmed markers of previously underappreciated
  nmSCs and nerve-associated fibroblasts. We also found and characterized two distinct
  populations of nerve-resident homeostatic myeloid cells that transcriptionally differed
  from central nervous system microglia. In a model of chronic autoimmune neuritis,
  homeostatic myeloid cells were outnumbered by infiltrating lymphocytes which modulated
  the local cell-cell interactome and induced a specific transcriptional response
  in glia cells. This response was partially shared between the peripheral and central
  nervous system glia, indicating common immunological features across different parts
  of the nervous system. Our study thus identifies subtypes and cell-type markers
  of PNS cells and a partially conserved autoimmunity module induced in glia cells.
