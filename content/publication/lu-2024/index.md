abstract: "5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motoneuron disease caused
  by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Adaptive immunity may contribute
  to SMA as described in other motoneuron diseases, yet mechanisms remain elusive.
  Nusinersen, an antisense treatment, enhances SMN2 expression, benefiting SMA patients.
  Here we have longitudinally investigated SMA and nusinersen effects on local immune
  responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - a surrogate of central nervous system
  parenchyma. Single-cell transcriptomics (SMA: N = 9 versus Control: N = 9) reveal
  NK cell and CD8+ T cell expansions in untreated SMA CSF, exhibiting activation and
  degranulation markers. Spatial transcriptomics coupled with multiplex immunohistochemistry
  elucidate cytotoxicity near chromatolytic motoneurons (N = 4). Post-nusinersen treatment,
  CSF shows unaltered protein/transcriptional profiles. These findings underscore
  cytotoxicity's role in SMA pathogenesis and propose it as a therapeutic target.
  Our study illuminates cell-mediated cytotoxicity as shared features across motoneuron
  diseases, suggesting broader implications. o̧pyright 2024. The Author(s)."
