abstract: B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), expressed in plasmablasts and plasma cells,
  could serve as a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. We reported
  here chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting BCMA in two patients with
  highly relapsed and refractory myasthenia gravis (one with AChR-IgG, and one with
  MuSk-IgG). Both patients exhibited favorable safety profiles and persistent clinical
  improvements over 18 months. Reconstitution of B-cell lineages with sustained reduced
  pathogenic autoantibodies might underlie the therapeutic efficacy. To identify the
  possible mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells in these
  patients, longitudinal single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing was conducted on serial
  blood samples post infusion as well as their matching infusion products. By tracking
  the temporal evolution of CAR-T phenotypes, we demonstrated that proliferating cytotoxic-like
  CD8 clones were the main effectors in autoimmunity, whereas compromised cytotoxic
  and proliferation signature and profound mitochondrial dysfunction in CD8+ Te cells
  before infusion and subsequently defect CAR-T cells after manufacture might explain
  their characteristics in these patients. Our findings may guide future studies to
  improve CAR T-cell immunotherapy in autoimmune diseases. o̧pyright 2024. The Author(s).
