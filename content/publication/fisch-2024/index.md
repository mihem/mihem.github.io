abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Flow cytometry is a widely used technique for
  identifying cell populations in patient-derived fluids, such as peripheral blood
  (PB) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Despite its ubiquity in research and clinical
  practice, the process of gating, i.e., manually identifying cell types, is labor-intensive
  and error-prone. The objective of this study is to address this challenge by introducing
  GateNet, a neural network architecture designed for fully end-to-end automated gating
  without the need for correcting batch effects. METHODS: For this study a unique
  dataset is used which comprises over 8,000,000 events from N = 127 PB and CSF samples
  which were manually labeled independently by four experts. Applying cross-validation,
  the classification performance of GateNet is compared to the human experts performance.
  Additionally, GateNet is applied to a publicly available dataset to evaluate generalization.
  The classification performance is measured using the F1 score. RESULTS: GateNet
  achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.910 to 0.997 demonstrating human-level performance
  on samples unseen during training. In the publicly available dataset, GateNet confirms
  its generalization capabilities with an F1 score of 0.936. Importantly, we also
  show that GateNet only requires ≈10 samples to reach human-level performance. Finally,
  gating with GateNet only takes 15 microseconds per event utilizing graphics processing
  units (GPU). CONCLUSIONS: GateNet enables fully end-to-end automated gating in flow
  cytometry, overcoming the labor-intensive and error-prone nature of manual adjustments.
  The neural network achieves human-level performance on unseen samples and generalizes
  well to diverse datasets. Notably, its data efficiency, requiring only ∼10 samples
  to reach human-level performance, positions GateNet as a widely applicable tool
  across various domains of flow cytometry. Copyright o̧pyright 2024 The Author(s).
