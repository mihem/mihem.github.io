abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease
  most frequently caused by autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against the acetylcholine receptor
  (AChR) located at the neuromuscular junction. Thymic follicular hyperplasia is present
  in most of the patients with early-onset AChR-Ab+ MG (EOMG), but its cellular and
  molecular drivers and development remain poorly understood. METHODS: We constructed
  a single cell-based transcriptional profile of lymphoid cell types in thymi from
  11 immunotherapy-naïve patients with EOMG. Multiplex histology and ELISA were used
  to determine migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels. RESULTS: Within EOMG thymi,
  we consistently observed 6 distinct clusters of B-cell populations maturing toward
  germinal center (GC)-associated and Ab-secreting cells, featuring prominent GC activity,
  as indicated by substantial clonal expansions and cycling B-cell subsets. Cell-cell
  interactome predictions identified strong interactions between T cells and GC-associated
  and memory B cells, dominated by B-cell prosurvival signaling through the MIF-CD74
  axis. Multiplex histology confirmed abundant expression of CD74 in MG thymic B cells.
  Circulating MIF levels in EOMG correlated with higher disease severity as assessed
  by Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America status. DISCUSSION: Our data not only
  illustrate and define hyperplastic thymic niches in MG as favorable environments
  for pathogenic B-cell proliferation, maturation, and persistence but also suggest
  that the MIF-CD74 axis should be investigated for potential novel therapeutic targeting
  in EOMG.'
