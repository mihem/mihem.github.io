abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Immune responses in the central nervous system
  (CNS) are highly compartmentalized and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in particular often
  reflects CNS pathology better than peripheral blood. While CSF leukocytes are known
  to be distinct from blood, the immediate effects of peripheral leukocyte depletion
  on CSF leukocytes have not been studied in humans. METHODS: We here analyzed CSF
  and blood from two relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients early
  after peripheral leukocyte depletion with the anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab compared
  to untreated RRMS and control patients using single cell RNA-sequencing. RESULTS:
  As expected for alemtuzumab, most leukocyte lineages including T cells were synchronously
  depleted from CSF and blood, while - surprisingly - pDCs were maintained in CSF
  but depleted from blood by alemtuzumab. Transcriptionally, genes associated with
  migration were elevated only in the CSF after alemtuzumab. Predicted cellular interactions
  indicated a central role of pDCs and enhanced migration signaling in the CSF after
  alemtuzumab. DISCUSSION: The CSF and blood compartments are thus partially uncoupled,
  emphasizing that the CNS is only partially accessible even for treatments profoundly
  affecting the blood.'
