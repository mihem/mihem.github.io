abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides unique insights into the
  brain and neurological diseases. However, the potential of CSF flow cytometry applied
  on a large scale remains unknown. METHODS: We used data-driven approaches to analyze
  paired CSF and blood flow cytometry measurements from 8,790 patients (discovery
  cohort) and CSF only data from 3,201 patients (validation cohort) collected across
  neurological diseases in a real-world setting. RESULTS: In somatoform controls (n = 788),
  activation of T cells increased with age in both CSF and blood, whereas double negative
  blood T cells (CD3+CD4-CD8-) decreased with age. A machine learning model of CSF
  and blood immune cells defined immune age, which correlated strongly with true biological
  age (r = 0.71). Classifying all diseases solely based on the CSF/blood parameters
  in 8,790 patients resulted in clusters of 4 disease categories: healthy, autoimmune,
  meningoencephalitis, and neurodegenerative. This clustering was validated in an
  analytically independent test dataset (8,790 patients) and in a temporally independent
  cohort (3,201 patients). Patients with multiple sclerosis were more likely to have
  progressive disease when assigned to the neurodegeneration cluster and to have lower
  disability in the autoimmune cluster. Patients with dementia in the neurodegeneration
  cluster showed more severe disease progression. Flow cytometry helped differentiate
  dementia from controls, thereby enhancing the diagnostic power of routine CSF diagnostics.
  INTERPRETATION: Flow cytometry of CSF and blood thus identifies site-specific aging
  patterns and disease-overarching patterns of neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:779-790.
