abstract: Patients suffering from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can develop
  neurological sequelae, such as headache, neuroinflammatory or cerebrovascular disease.
  These conditions - here termed Neuro-COVID - are more frequent in patients with
  severe COVID-19. To understand the etiology of these neurological sequelae, we utilized
  single-cell sequencing and examined the immune cell profiles from the cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) of Neuro-COVID patients compared to patients with non-inflammatory and
  autoimmune neurological diseases or with viral encephalitis. The CSF of Neuro-COVID
  patients exhibited an expansion of dedifferentiated monocytes and of exhausted CD4+
  T cells. Neuro-COVID CSF leukocytes featured an enriched interferon signature; however,
  this was less pronounced than in viral encephalitis. Repertoire analysis revealed
  broad clonal T cell expansion and curtailed interferon response in severe compared
  to mild Neuro-COVID patients. Collectively, our findings document the CSF immune
  compartment in Neuro-COVID patients and suggest compromised antiviral responses
  in this setting.
