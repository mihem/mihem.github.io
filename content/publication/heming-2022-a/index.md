abstract: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) features a unique immune cell composition
  and is in constant contact with the brain borders, thus permitting insights into
  the brain to diagnose and monitor diseases. Recently, the meninges, which are filled
  with CSF, were identified as a neuroimmunological interface, highlighting the potential
  of exploring central nervous system (CNS) immunity by studying CNS border compartments.
  Here, we summarize how single-cell transcriptomics of such border compartments advance
  our understanding of neurological diseases, the challenges that remain, and what
  opportunities novel multi-omic methods offer. Single-cell transcriptomics studies
  have detected cytotoxic CD4+ T cells and clonally expanded T and B cells in the
  CSF in the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis; clonally expanded pathogenic CD8+
  T cells were found in the CSF and in the brain adjacent to β-amyloid plaques of
  dementia patients; in patients with brain metastases, CD8+ T cell clonotypes were
  shared between the brain parenchyma and the CSF and persisted after therapy. We
  also outline how novel multi-omic approaches permit the simultaneous measurements
  of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and protein in the same cells, which
  remain to be explored in the CSF. This calls for multicenter initiatives to create
  single-cell atlases, posing challenges in integrating patients and modalities across
  centers. While high-dimensional analyses of CSF cells are challenging, they hold
  potential for personalized medicine by better resolving heterogeneous diseases and
  stratifying patients.
