title: Stroke induces disease-specific myeloid cells in the brain parenchyma and pia
subtitle: ''
summary: 'We deeply characterize tissue-resident leukocytes in meninges and brain parenchyma and discover that leukocytes respond differently to stroke depending on their site of residence. We thereby discover a unique phenotype of myeloid cells exclusive to the brain after stroke. These stroke-associated myeloid cells partially resemble neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia. They are mainly of resident microglial origin, partially conserved in humans and exhibit a lipid-phagocytosing phenotype. Blocking markers specific for these cells partially ameliorates stroke outcome thus providing a potential therapeutic target. '

abstract: Inflammation triggers secondary brain damage after stroke. The meninges
  and other CNS border compartments serve as invasion sites for leukocyte influx into
  the brain thus promoting tissue damage after stroke. However, the post-ischemic
  immune response of border compartments compared to brain parenchyma remains poorly
  characterized. Here, we deeply characterize tissue-resident leukocytes in meninges
  and brain parenchyma and discover that leukocytes respond differently to stroke
  depending on their site of residence. We thereby discover a unique phenotype of
  myeloid cells exclusive to the brain after stroke. These stroke-associated myeloid
  cells partially resemble neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia. They are
  mainly of resident microglial origin, partially conserved in humans and exhibit
  a lipid-phagocytosing phenotype. Blocking markers specific for these cells partially
  ameliorates stroke outcome thus providing a potential therapeutic target. The injury-response
  of myeloid cells in the CNS is thus compartmentalized, adjusted to the type of injury
  and may represent a therapeutic target.
