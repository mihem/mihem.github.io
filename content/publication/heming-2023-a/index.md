abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Neurological manifestations of autoimmune connective tissue
  diseases (CTD) are poorly understood and difficult to diagnose. We here aimed to
  address this shortcoming by studying immune cell compositions in CTD patients with
  and without neurological manifestation. METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we retrospectively
  investigated paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples of 28 CTD patients
  without neurological manifestation, 38 CTD patients with neurological manifestation
  (N-CTD), 38 non-inflammatory controls, and 38 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients,
  a paradigmatic primary neuroinflammatory disease. RESULTS: We detected an expansion
  of plasma cells in the blood of both N-CTD and CTD compared to non-inflammatory
  controls and MS. Blood plasma cells alone distinguished the clinically similar entities
  N-CTD and MS with high discriminatory performance (AUC: 0.81). Classical blood monocytes
  indicated higher disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients.
  Surprisingly, immune cells in the CSF did not differ significantly between N-CTD
  and CTD, while CD4+ T cells and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were elevated in the blood of
  N-CTD compared to CTD. Several B cell-associated parameters partially overlapped
  in the CSF in MS and N-CTD. We built a machine learning model that distinguished
  N-CTD from MS with high discriminatory power using either blood or CSF. CONCLUSION:
  We here find that blood flow cytometry alone surprisingly suffices to distinguish
  CTD with neurological manifestations from clinically similar entities, suggesting
  that a rapid blood test could support clinicians in the differential diagnosis of
  N-CTD.'
