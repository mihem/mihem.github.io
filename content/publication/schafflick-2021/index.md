title: Single-cell profiling of CNS border compartment leukocytes reveals that B cells
  and their progenitors reside in non-diseased meninges.
subtitle: ''
summary: Based on single-cell transcriptomics, we here identify a highly location-specific composition and expression profile of tissue-resident leukocytes in CNS border compartments featuring B cells and their progenitors in the dura as an unexpected site of B cell residence.

abstract: The CNS is ensheathed by the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, and recent
  findings suggest that these CNS-associated border tissues have complex immunological
  functions. Unlike myeloid lineage cells, lymphocytes in border compartments have
  yet to be thoroughly characterized. Based on single-cell transcriptomics, we here
  identified a highly location-specific composition and expression profile of tissue-resident
  leukocytes in CNS parenchyma, pia-enriched subdural meninges, dura mater, choroid
  plexus and cerebrospinal fluid. The dura layer of the meninges contained a large
  population of B cells under homeostatic conditions in mice and rats. Murine dura
  B cells exhibited slow turnover and long-term tissue residency, and they matured
  in experimental neuroinflammation. The dura also contained B lineage progenitors
  at the pro-B cell stage typically not found outside of bone marrow, without direct
  influx from the periphery or the skull bone marrow. This identified the dura as
  an unexpected site of B cell residence and potentially of development in both homeostasis
  and neuroinflammation.
