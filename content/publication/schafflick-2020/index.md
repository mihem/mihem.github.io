abstract: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protects the central nervous system (CNS) and
  analyzing CSF aids the diagnosis of CNS diseases, but our understanding of CSF leukocytes
  remains superficial. Here, using single cell transcriptomics, we identify a specific
  location-associated composition and transcriptome of CSF leukocytes. Multiple sclerosis
  (MS) - an autoimmune disease of the CNS - increases transcriptional diversity in
  blood, but increases cell type diversity in CSF including a higher abundance of
  cytotoxic phenotype T helper cells. An analytical approach, named cell set enrichment
  analysis (CSEA) identifies a cluster-independent increase of follicular (TFH) cells
  potentially driving the known expansion of B lineage cells in the CSF in MS. In
  mice, TFH cells accordingly promote B cell infiltration into the CNS and the severity
  of MS animal models. Immune mechanisms in MS are thus highly compartmentalized and
  indicate ongoing local T/B cell interaction.
