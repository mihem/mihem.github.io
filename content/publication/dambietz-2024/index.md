abstract: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a severe fungal disease in immunocompromised
  patients affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Host response and immunological
  alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after invasion of Cryptococcus neoformans
  to the central nervous system have been investigated before but rigorous and comprehensive
  studies examining cellular changes in the CSF of patients with cryptococccal meningitis
  are still rare. We retrospectively collected CSF analysis and flow cytometry data
  of CSF and blood in patients with CM (n = 7) and compared them to HIV positive patients
  without meningitis (n = 13) and HIV negative healthy controls (n = 7). Within the
  group of patients with CM we compared those with HIV infection (n = 3) or other
  immunocompromised conditions (n = 4). Flow cytometry analysis revealed an elevation
  of natural killer cells and natural killer T cells in the CSF and blood of HIV negative
  patients with CM, pointing to innate immune activation in early stages after fungal
  invasion. HIV positive patients with CM exhibited stronger blood-CSF-barrier disruption.
  Follow-up CSF analysis over up to 150 days showed heterogeneous cellular courses
  in CM patients with slow normalization of CSF after induction of antifungal therapy.
