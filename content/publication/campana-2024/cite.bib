 abstract = {Neuroinflammation and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB) disruption could be key elements in schizophrenia-spectrum disorderś(\SSDs) etiology and symptom modulation. We present the largest two-stage individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, investigating the association of BCB disruption and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alterations with symptom severity in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and recent onset psychotic disorder (ROP) individuals, with a focus on sex-related differences. Data was collected from PubMed and EMBASE databases. FEP, ROP and high-risk syndromes for psychosis IPD were included if routine basic CSF-diagnostics were reported. Risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated. Random-effects meta-analyses and mixed-effects linear regression models were employed to assess the impact of BCB alterations on symptom severity. Published (6 studies) and unpublished IPD from n = 531 individuals was included in the analyses. CSF was altered in 38.8 % of individuals. No significant differences in symptom severity were found between individuals with and without CSF alterations (SMD = -0.17, 95 %CI -0.55-0.22, p = 0.341). However, males with elevated CSF/serum albumin ratios or any CSF alteration had significantly higher positive symptom scores than those without alterations (SMD = 0.34, 95 %CI 0.05-0.64, p = 0.037 and SMD = 0.29, 95 %CI 0.17-0.41p = 0.005, respectively). Mixed-effects and simple regression models showed no association (p \textgreater 0.1) between CSF parameters and symptomatic outcomes. No interaction between sex and CSF parameters was found (p \textgreater 0.1). BCB disruption appears highly prevalent in early psychosis and could be involved in positive symptomś severity in males, indicating potential difficult-to-treat states. This work highlights the need for considering BCB breakdownand sex-related differences in \SSDs clinical trials and treatment strategies. Copyright o̧pyright 2024 The Authors.
