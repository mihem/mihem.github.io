abstract: Neuroinflammation and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB) disruption
  could be key elements in schizophrenia-spectrum disorderś(SSDs) etiology and symptom
  modulation. We present the largest two-stage individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis,
  investigating the association of BCB disruption and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alterations
  with symptom severity in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and recent onset psychotic
  disorder (ROP) individuals, with a focus on sex-related differences. Data was collected
  from PubMed and EMBASE databases. FEP, ROP and high-risk syndromes for psychosis
  IPD were included if routine basic CSF-diagnostics were reported. Risk of bias of
  the included studies was evaluated. Random-effects meta-analyses and mixed-effects
  linear regression models were employed to assess the impact of BCB alterations on
  symptom severity. Published (6 studies) and unpublished IPD from n = 531 individuals
  was included in the analyses. CSF was altered in 38.8 % of individuals. No significant
  differences in symptom severity were found between individuals with and without
  CSF alterations (SMD = -0.17, 95 %CI -0.55-0.22, p = 0.341). However, males with
  elevated CSF/serum albumin ratios or any CSF alteration had significantly higher
  positive symptom scores than those without alterations (SMD = 0.34, 95 %CI 0.05-0.64,
  p = 0.037 and SMD = 0.29, 95 %CI 0.17-0.41p = 0.005, respectively). Mixed-effects
  and simple regression models showed no association (p textgreater 0.1) between CSF
  parameters and symptomatic outcomes. No interaction between sex and CSF parameters
  was found (p textgreater 0.1). BCB disruption appears highly prevalent in early
  psychosis and could be involved in positive symptomś severity in males, indicating
  potential difficult-to-treat states. This work highlights the need for considering
  BCB breakdownand sex-related differences in SSDs clinical trials and treatment strategies.
