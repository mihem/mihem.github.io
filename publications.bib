abstract = {B-cell maturation antigen ({BCMA}), expressed in plasmablasts and plasma cells, could serve as a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. We reported here chimeric antigen receptor ({CAR}) T cells targeting {BCMA} in two patients with highly relapsed and refractory myasthenia gravis (one with {AChR}-{IgG}, and one with {MuSk}-{IgG}). Both patients exhibited favorable safety profiles and persistent clinical improvements over 18 months. Reconstitution of B-cell lineages with sustained reduced pathogenic autoantibodies might underlie the therapeutic efficacy. To identify the possible mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of {CAR}-T cells in these patients, longitudinal single-cell {RNA} and {TCR} sequencing was conducted on serial blood samples post infusion as well as their matching infusion products. By tracking the temporal evolution of {CAR}-T phenotypes, we demonstrated that proliferating cytotoxic-like {CD8} clones were the main effectors in autoimmunity, whereas compromised cytotoxic and proliferation signature and profound mitochondrial dysfunction in {CD8}+ Te cells before infusion and subsequently defect {CAR}-T cells after manufacture might explain their characteristics in these patients. Our findings may guide future studies to improve {CAR} T-cell immunotherapy in autoimmune diseases. \copyright 2024. The Author(s).}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {OBJECTIVE}: Flow cytometry is a widely used technique for identifying cell populations in patient-derived fluids, such as peripheral blood ({PB}) or cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}). Despite its ubiquity in research and clinical practice, the process of gating, i.e., manually identifying cell types, is labor-intensive and error-prone. The objective of this study is to address this challenge by introducing {GateNet}, a neural network architecture designed for fully end-to-end automated gating without the need for correcting batch effects. {METHODS}: For this study a unique dataset is used which comprises over 8,000,000 events from N = 127 {PB} and {CSF} samples which were manually labeled independently by four experts. Applying cross-validation, the classification performance of {GateNet} is compared to the human experts performance. Additionally, {GateNet} is applied to a publicly available dataset to evaluate generalization. The classification performance is measured using the F1 score. {RESULTS}: {GateNet} achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.910 to 0.997 demonstrating human-level performance on samples unseen during training. In the publicly available dataset, {GateNet} confirms its generalization capabilities with an F1 score of 0.936. Importantly, we also show that {GateNet} only requires ≈10 samples to reach human-level performance. Finally, gating with {GateNet} only takes 15 microseconds per event utilizing graphics processing units ({GPU}). {CONCLUSIONS}: {GateNet} enables fully end-to-end automated gating in flow cytometry, overcoming the labor-intensive and error-prone nature of manual adjustments. The neural network achieves human-level performance on unseen samples and generalizes well to diverse datasets. Notably, its data efficiency, requiring only ∼10 samples to reach human-level performance, positions {GateNet} as a widely applicable tool across various domains of flow cytometry.

abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptor ({CAR}) T cell immunotherapy for the treatment of neurological autoimmune diseases is promising, but {CAR} T cell kinetics and immune alterations after treatment are poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell multi-omics sequencing of paired cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) and blood samples from patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder ({NMOSD}) treated with anti-B cell maturation antigen ({BCMA}) {CAR} T cells. Proliferating cytotoxic-like {CD8}+ {CAR} T cell clones were identified as the main effectors in autoimmunity. Anti-{BCMA} {CAR} T cells with enhanced features of chemotaxis efficiently crossed the blood-{CSF} barrier, eliminated plasmablasts and plasma cells in the {CSF}, and suppressed neuroinflammation. The {CD44}-expressing early memory phenotype in infusion products was potentially associated with {CAR} T cell persistence in autoimmunity. Moreover, {CAR} T cells from patients with {NMOSD} displayed distinctive features of suppressed cytotoxicity compared with those from hematological malignancies. Thus, we provide mechanistic insights into {CAR} T cell function in patients with neurological autoimmune disease.}

Adaptive immunity may contribute to {SMA} as described in other motoneuron diseases, yet mechanisms remain elusive. Nusinersen, an antisense treatment, enhances {SMN2} expression, benefiting {SMA} patients. Here we have longitudinally investigated {SMA} and nusinersen effects on local immune responses in the cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) - a surrogate of central nervous system parenchyma. Single-cell transcriptomics ({SMA}: N = 9 versus Control: N = 9) reveal {NK} cell and {CD8}+ T cell expansions in untreated {SMA} {CSF}, exhibiting activation and degranulation markers. Spatial transcriptomics coupled with multiplex immunohistochemistry elucidate cytotoxicity near chromatolytic motoneurons (N = 4). Post-nusinersen treatment, {CSF} shows unaltered protein/transcriptional profiles. These findings underscore cytotoxicity's role in {SMA} pathogenesis and propose it as a therapeutic target. Our study illuminates cell-mediated cytotoxicity as shared features across motoneuron diseases, suggesting broader implications. \copyright 2024. The Author(s).}

abstract = {Neuroinflammation and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier ({BCB}) disruption could be key elements in schizophrenia-spectrum disorderś({\SSDs}) etiology and symptom modulation. We present the largest two-stage individual patient data ({IPD}) meta-analysis, investigating the association of {BCB} disruption and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) alterations with symptom severity in first-episode psychosis ({FEP}) and recent onset psychotic disorder ({ROP}) individuals, with a focus on sex-related differences. Data was collected from {PubMed} and {EMBASE} databases. {FEP}, {ROP} and high-risk syndromes for psychosis {IPD} were included if routine basic {CSF}-diagnostics were reported. Risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated. Random-effects meta-analyses and mixed-effects linear regression models were employed to assess the impact of {BCB} alterations on symptom severity. Published (6 studies) and unpublished {IPD} from n = 531 individuals was included in the analyses. {CSF} was altered in 38.8 \% of individuals. No significant differences in symptom severity were found between individuals with and without {CSF} alterations ({SMD} = -0.17, 95 \%{CI} -0.55-0.22, p = 0.341). However, males with elevated {CSF}/serum albumin ratios or any {CSF} alteration had significantly higher positive symptom scores than those without alterations ({SMD} = 0.34, 95 \%{CI} 0.05-0.64, p = 0.037 and {SMD} = 0.29, 95 \%{CI} 0.17-0.41p = 0.005, respectively). Mixed-effects and simple regression models showed no association (p \textgreater 0.1) between {CSF} parameters and symptomatic outcomes. No interaction between sex and {CSF} parameters was found (p \textgreater 0.1). {BCB} disruption appears highly prevalent in early psychosis and could be involved in positive symptomś severity in males, indicating potential difficult-to-treat states. This work highlights the need for considering {BCB} breakdownand sex-related differences in {\SSDs} clinical trials and treatment strategies. Copyright \copyright 2024 The Authors.

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) provides unique insights into the brain and neurological diseases. However, the potential of {CSF} flow cytometry applied on a large scale remains unknown. {METHODS}: We used data-driven approaches to analyze paired {CSF} and blood flow cytometry measurements from 8,790 patients (discovery cohort) and {CSF} only data from 3,201 patients (validation cohort) collected across neurological diseases in a real-world setting. {RESULTS}: In somatoform controls (n = 788), activation of T cells increased with age in both {CSF} and blood, whereas double negative blood T cells ({CD3}+{CD4}-{CD8}-) decreased with age. A machine learning model of {CSF} and blood immune cells defined immune age, which correlated strongly with true biological age (r = 0.71). Classifying all diseases solely based on the {CSF}/blood parameters in 8,790 patients resulted in clusters of 4 disease categories: healthy, autoimmune, meningoencephalitis, and neurodegenerative. This clustering was validated in an analytically independent test dataset (8,790 patients) and in a temporally independent cohort (3,201 patients). Patients with multiple sclerosis were more likely to have progressive disease when assigned to the neurodegeneration cluster and to have lower disability in the autoimmune cluster. Patients with dementia in the neurodegeneration cluster showed more severe disease progression. Flow cytometry helped differentiate dementia from controls, thereby enhancing the diagnostic power of routine {CSF} diagnostics. {INTERPRETATION}: Flow cytometry of {CSF} and blood thus identifies site-specific aging patterns and disease-overarching patterns of neurodegeneration. {ANN} {NEUROL} 2025;97:779-790. \copyright 2024 The Author(s).

We retrospectively collected {CSF} analysis and flow cytometry data of {CSF} and blood in patients with {CM} (n = 7) and compared them to {HIV} positive patients without meningitis (n = 13) and {HIV} negative healthy controls (n = 7). Within the group of patients with {CM} we compared those with {HIV} infection (n = 3) or other immunocompromised conditions (n = 4). Flow cytometry analysis revealed an elevation of natural killer cells and natural killer T cells in the {CSF} and blood of {HIV} negative patients with {CM}, pointing to innate immune activation in early stages after fungal invasion. {HIV} positive patients with {CM} exhibited stronger blood-{CSF}-barrier disruption.

However, the drivers of the antibody-secreting cells ({ASC}) and involvement of T cells remain unresolved. We performed single cell {RNA}-sequencing of fresh cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) and parallel blood samples of 15 patients with {LGI1}- (n=9) and {CASPR2}-{AIE} (n=6) compared to control patients (multiple sclerosis ({MS}) n=15, idiopathic intracranial hypertension ({IIH}) n=18). We validated our observations in independent cohorts using flow cytometry of {CSF} and blood. We confirmed autoantibody specificity using recombinant human monoclonal antibodies. Compared to {IIH} and {MS} controls, we observed clonal {CSF}-specific {ASC} expansion in {LGI1}/{CASPR2}-{AIE} despite mostly normal {CSF} findings. {ASCs} were dominantly plasmablasts and transcribed {IgG4} and {IgG1}/2 heavy chains. Expanded clones showed signs of affinity maturation and bound the respective neuronal autoantigen. Within {CD4} and {CD8} T cell clusters, {CD4} and {CD8} central memory T cells were activated, clonally restricted and expanded. T cell clones were often shared between {CSF} and blood. We also observed a shift of {NK} cells and loss of mucosa-associated invariant T ({MAIT}) cells in the {CSF} of {LGI1}- and blood of {LGI1}- and {CASPR2}-{AIE} compared to {IIH} and {MS} controls. Indeed, {MAIT}-like T cells were detected in autopsy brains of {LGI1} and {CASPR2}-{AIE} patients and mice lacking {MAIT} cells displayed an increased antibody seroconversion and higher titers following active {LGI1}-/{CASPR2} immunization. Our data (1) confirms the intrathecal antigen-specific plasma cell expansion in {LGI1}- and {CASPR2}-{AIE} in a large cohort of untreated {AIE} patients, (2) suggests that activated and expanded central memory {CD4} and {CD8} T cells in the {CSF} participate in disease pathogenesis and (3) for the first time implicates invariant T cell receptor expressing lymphocytes in the brain, {CSF} and blood in disease pathogenesis. \copyright The Author(s) 2025.

Multiplex histology and {ELISA} were used to determine migration inhibitory factor ({MIF}) levels. {RESULTS}: Within {EOMG} thymi, we consistently observed 6 distinct clusters of B-cell populations maturing toward germinal center ({GC})-associated and Ab-secreting cells, featuring prominent {GC} activity, as indicated by substantial clonal expansions and cycling B-cell subsets. Cell-cell interactome predictions identified strong interactions between T cells and {GC}-associated and memory B cells, dominated by B-cell prosurvival signaling through the {MIF}-{CD74} axis. Multiplex histology confirmed abundant expression of {CD74} in {MG} thymic B cells. Circulating {MIF} levels in {EOMG} correlated with higher disease severity as assessed by Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America status. {DISCU\SSION}: Our data not only illustrate and define hyperplastic thymic niches in {MG} as favorable environments for pathogenic B-cell proliferation, maturation, and persistence but also suggest that the {MIF}-{CD74} axis should be investigated for potential novel therapeutic targeting in {EOMG}.}
